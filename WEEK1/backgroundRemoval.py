    # Gaussian filterning is used to remove noises in the image

    # Otsu's thresholding gives an arbitrary chosen value as a threshold
    # Image with only two distinct image values (eg: background and painting)
    # where the histogram would only consist of two peaks, 
    # a good threshold would be in the middle of those two values

# METHOD 2
# 1. Convert our image into Greyscale
# 2. Perform simple thresholding to build a mask for the foreground and background
# 3. Determine the foreground and background based on the mask
# 4. Reconstruct original image by combining foreground and background

#METHOD 3
#Convert our image into HSV color space
#Perform simple thresholding to create a map using Numpy based on Saturation and Value
#Combine the map from S and V into a final mask
#Determine the foreground and background based on the combined mask
#Reconstruct original image by combining extracted foreground and background
